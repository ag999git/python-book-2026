### 2. Point-wise Comparison between Hash (#) and triple quotes (''' or """)

**1\. Hash (#) — Single-Line Comments**

*   Starts with # and continues to the end of the line.
*   Used mainly for explaining **logic**, **steps**, or **reasoning** inside the code.
*   Helpful for programmers who want to **understand, debug, or modify** the code.
*   Typically scattered throughout functions and code blocks.
*   Can be used for multi-line comments by repeating # on each line.
*   Ignored entirely by the Python interpreter.

**2\. Triple Quotes (''' or """) — Multi-Line Strings Used as Comments**

*   Written using triple single quotes ''' or triple double quotes """.
*   Technically creates a **multi-line string**, not a true comment — but becomes a "comment" only if unused.
*   Mainly used for **docstrings**: documentation for modules, classes, and functions.
*   Appears immediately after a def or class statement.
*   Describes **usage**, **purpose**, **arguments**, and **returns** — the _user interface_.
*   Tools like Sphinx, pydoc, and IDEs can automatically extract them.
*   Can also be placed on one line as a single-line docstring.

Comparison:-

| Feature / Purpose | # Single-Line Comment | ''’ / """ Multi-Line Comment (Docstring) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Syntax | # comment | """ comment """ or ''' comment ''' |
| Type | True comment | Multi-line string used as a comment or docstring |
| Interpreter behavior | Completely ignored | Created as a string; ignored only if not assigned or used |
| Typical use | Explain logic or code steps | Document modules, classes, and functions |
| Audience | Programmers modifying/understanding code | Users who want to know how to use the code |
| Location | Anywhere in code | Usually immediately after def, class, or module top |
| Extraction by tools | Not extracted | Automatically extracted by documentation tools |
| Best for | Inline explanations and quick notes | Official documentation of API/usage |
| Multi-line use | Yes, by repeating # on each line | Naturally supports multi-line formatting |
| Single-line use | Yes | Possible by placing opening and closing quotes on the same line |

If you as a beginner are unable to follow/ understand some of the points, don’t worry. They will become clear to you as you progress.


### 3. Good Rules for Writing Identifiers in Python. Follow the basic legal rules
    
    These rules are required by Python itself:-
    
    1.  Use letters (A–Z, a–z), digits (0–9), and underscores (_)  
        Example: total_marks, value2, Student_Name
        
    2.  Identifier cannot start with a digit  
        1value is wrong, so is 2value
        
    3.  value1 is OK
        
    4.  Keywords cannot be identifiers  
        Examples you _cannot_ use:  
        for, while, print, break, class etc.
        
    5.  No special symbols  
        Cannot use-> age@school, first-name, price$
        
    6.  Python is case-sensitive  
        student ≠ Student ≠ STUDENT



### 4. What are PEP and PEP 8 in Python? (Simple Explanation)

#### 4.1 PEP = Python Enhancement Proposal

A **PEP is a document** that explains:

*   **new features** to be added to Python
*   **how** Python should work
*   **guidelines** and **best practices** for writing Python code
*   **changes** or **improvements** to the language

**Think of PEPs like a rulebook + suggestion box**  
They help Python stay organized, consistent, and easy to develop.

**Simple example (analogy):**

Imagine a school where teachers write proposals to improve rules:

*   "Let’s add a computer lab."
*   "Let’s change the uniform color."

Python developers do the same → they write **PEPs** to propose improvements.

#### 4.2 What is PEP 8

**PEP 8 = The official Style Guide for Python code**

PEP 8 tells Python programmers:

*   how to **format** their code
*   how to **name** variables, functions, and classes
*   how many spaces to use
*   where to put blank lines
*   how to write code that is clean, readable, and consistent

**Think of PEP 8 like English grammar rules but for Python.**  
Just like grammar makes English easier to read, PEP 8 makes Python code easier for everyone to understand.

#### 4.3  PEP  8

*   | PEP 8 Topic | What It Means | PEP 8 Example (Correct) | Non-PEP 8 Example (Incorrect) |
    | --- | --- | --- | --- |
    | Indentation | Use 4 spaces per indentation level | if x > 5:    print(x) | if x > 5:print(x) (with incorrect spacing or tabs in actual code) |
    | Tabs vs Spaces | Prefer spaces over tabs | if x > 5:    print(x) | if x > 5:    print(x) (using tab character) |
    | Maximum Line Length | Keep lines under 79 characters | # Short comment line | # Very long comment line that exceeds 79 characters and is hard to read |
    | Blank Lines | Use blank lines to separate sections | Two blank lines before class or function | No blank lines between sections |
    | Imports | Keep imports at the top, one per line | import os <br> import sys | import os, sys |
    | Import Order | Standard library → Third-party → Local | import os # Standard library <br> import numpy # Third party  <br>  import mymodule # Local | Random or mixed ordering |
    | Naming Conventions | Use snake_case, PascalCase, UPPER_CASE | Variable: total_amount,Class: BankAccount, Constant: MAX_SIZE | TotalAmount, bank_account, maxsize |
    | Whitespace Rules | Avoid unnecessary spaces | a = b + c | a=b+c or a = b + c |
    | Comments | Write clear comments | # Calculate total price | #calc price <br> or obvious comments like <br> # increment i |
    | Docstrings | Use triple quotes to document functions | """Returns sum of two numbers.""" | Using # comments instead of docstrings |
    | Code Layout | Keep code clean and structured | Organised, readable code | Messy, inconsistent layout |
    | Boolean Comparisons | Use direct checks | if is_ready: | if is_ready == True: |
    | Compare with None using is/is not | Follow Pythonic way | if x is None: | if x == None: |
    | Function & Variable Names | Use lowercase_with_underscores | get_value(), student_age | GetValue(), StudentAge, studentAge |
    | Class Names | Use PascalCase | CarModel | carmodel, car_model, carModel |
    | Constant Names | Use UPPER_CASE | MAX_SPEED = 120 | maxspeed = 120 |
    | Spacing After Commas | Put a space after commas | sum(1, 2, 3) | sum(1,2,3) |
    | Single Statement per Line | Use one statement per line | x = 1; y = 2 (preferred to split in two lines) | x = 1; y = 2 (not recommended in practice) |

#### 4.4 Pep 8 Vs Non-pep 8 Examples
##### The following code in Python gives example of use of PEP 8 versus non-PEP 8 for:-
*   Variables
  
*   Functions
    
*   Loops
    
*   Conditionals
    
*   Comments

```python

# PEP 8 vs Non-PEP 8 Python Code Examples

# -------------------------------
# Variables
# -------------------------------

# PEP 8 style
student_age = 20
total_score = 95
MAX_LIMIT = 100

# Non-PEP 8 style
StudentAge=20
totalScore=95
maxlimit=100  # variable names not following conventions


# -------------------------------
# Functions
# -------------------------------

# PEP 8 style
def calculate_average(score1, score2, score3):
    total = score1 + score2 + score3
    return total / 3

# Non-PEP 8 style
def CalculateAverage(score1,score2,score3): total=score1+score2+score3;return total/3


# -------------------------------
# Loops
# -------------------------------

# PEP 8 style
for i in range(5):
    print(i)

# Non-PEP 8 style
for i in range(5): print(i)  # multiple statements in single line


# -------------------------------
# Conditionals
# -------------------------------

# PEP 8 style
x = 10
if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")
elif x == 5:
    print("x is equal to 5")
else:
    print("x is less than 5")

# Non-PEP 8 style
x=10
if x>5: print("x>5")
elif x==5: print("x==5")
else: print("x<5")


# -------------------------------
# Comments
# -------------------------------

# PEP 8 style
# This function calculates the square of a number
def square(n):
    return n * n

# Non-PEP 8 style
def square(n): return n*n #function to calc square


# -------------------------------
# Private / Internal Names — begin with underscore (Not enforced by Python, but recommended.)
# -------------------------------

# PEP 8 style
_calculate_internal_grades()  # This function is to be used internally

# Non-PEP 8 style
calculate_internal_grades()  # This is an internal function/ private to the script. Should start with underscore


```


### 5. Table: Identifiers vs Variables

    
| Feature | Identifier | Variable |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Definition** | A name used to identify something in Python | A memory location that stores a value |
| **What it represents** | Can represent variables, functions, classes, modules, etc. | Only represents data stored in memory |
| **Creation **| Created when you write a name (e.g., myFunc) | Created only after assignment (e.g., x = 10) |
| **Has value?** | No | Yes |
| **Has type?** | No | Yes (type of stored value) |
| **Has scope?** | Depends on what it names | Yes — local, global, class-level |
| **Example** | sum, my_list, print, Car | x = 5, name = "Anurag" |
| **Error if missing?** | Undefined identifier → NameError | Same, because variable name is an identifier |
| **Used for** | Naming program components | Storing and manipulating data |
