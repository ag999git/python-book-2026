### 1 Anaconda

#### 1.1 Introduction

##### 1.1.1  The Client–Server Model of Jupyter Notebook

Even though Anaconda and Jupyter Notebook run on your local computer, they still follow a client–server architecture internally.

That means:

•  Server = Python backend running on your computer

•  Client = Your web browser (Chrome/Edge/Firefox)

So you are still using your computer as:- Both the client AND the server

###### 1. Server: Jupyter Notebook Server

When you run:

`jupyter notebook`

or click “Launch” in Anaconda Navigator:

→ A small Python program called the Jupyter Notebook Server starts running in the background.

This server:

  -  Runs on your machine

  -  Manages files and notebooks

  -  Executes Python code

  -  Provides web pages for the interface

  -  Communicates with the browser using WebSockets

The server usually runs at:

`http://localhost:8888`

localhost means:

  - Your own computer is acting as a server.

###### 2. Client: Your Web Browser

The Jupyter interface you see is just a website that your local server provides.

The browser:

  - Displays notebooks

  - Sends your code to the server

  - Receives output (text, images, errors)

  - Updates the notebook content

So the browser acts as a client UI.

1.1.2 Behind-the-Scenes: How Code Execution Works

•  Step-by-step internal process: 

  1.  You type Python code in a cell in your browser.

  2.  Browser sends the cell code to the Jupyter server.

  3.  The server sends the code to a kernel (usually IPython).

  4.  The kernel executes the code.

  5.  The result (text/plots/errors) is sent back to the server.

  6.  The server sends the result to your browser.

  7.  Browser displays the output in the notebook.

This process happens in milliseconds.

##### 1.1.3 What Is the Kernel (Internally)?

A kernel is a separate background process that executes code.

For Python notebooks, it is the IPython kernel:

•  Runs your Python code

•  Maintains variable state

•  Stores memory

•  Handles errors

•  Generates outputs

Even if the browser is closed, the kernel may keep running until stopped.

##### 1.1.4 Client–Server Role of Anaconda

Anaconda itself is not a client–server app, but:

It launches applications that use the model

It manages environments and packages that these apps need

  -  Internally, Anaconda Navigator:

  -  Runs as a local desktop GUI application

  -  Acts as a launcher for tools

  -  Starts Jupyter Notebook server when asked

  -  Manages Python environments

Think of it like a control panel, not a server.

##### 1.1.5 How Everything Fits Together

✔ When you start Jupyter from Anaconda:

1.  Anaconda starts the Jupyter Notebook Server

2.  The server listens on a port on your machine

    - Example: `localhost:8888`

3.  Your browser opens the interface

4.  The browser sends code → server → kernel

5.  Kernel executes code and returns results

6.  Browser displays the output

1.1.6 Why use a client–server model locally?

Even though everything is on your computer, this model gives benefits:

  -  Benefit 1: Browser-based interface:- You don’t need a separate desktop app.

  -  Benefit 2: Remote execution:- Same model works on remote servers (e.g., Google Colab, JupyterHub, cloud).

  -  Benefit 3: Allows multiple clients:- Multiple browser tabs can talk to the same kernel.

  -  Benefit 4: Language independence:- Kernel can be Python, R, Julia, etc., while browser stays the same.

[Back to the Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)
#### 1.2 PART 1: Installing Anaconda (which includes Jupyter Notebook)

[Back to the Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

Anaconda is the easiest and recommended way for beginners to use Python and Jupyter Notebook.

##### 1.2.1 STEP 1 — Go to the Anaconda Website

  1.  Open your web browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox).
  2.  Go to: `https://www.anaconda.com/download`

##### 1.2.2 STEP 2 — Download the Windows Installer

  1.  Scroll to “Download Anaconda Distribution”.

  2.  Choose:

   - Operating System: Windows

   - Python Version: Choose `Python 3.x` (default is fine)
  3.  Click Download 64-bit Installer.

A file called something like:

`Anaconda3-2024.XX-Windows-x86_64.exe`

will start downloading.

##### 1.2.3 STEP 3 — Run the Installer

###### 1.  Locate the downloaded .exe file (usually in Downloads).

###### 2.  Double-click it to start the installation.

##### 1.2.4 STEP 4 — Initial Installer Screens

Click Next → Accept the license → Next.

##### 1.2.5 STEP 5 — Installation Type

Choose:

  -  Just Me (recommended. Unless you know how admin installation works.)

  -  Click Next.

1.2.6 STEP 6 — Choose Install Location

Leave it default:

`C:\Users\<yourname>\Anaconda3`

  -  Click Next.

**IMPORTANT STEP: PATH Checkbox**

You will see two checkboxes:

✔ Add Anaconda to my PATH environment variable (NOT recommended—leave unchecked)

> [!NOTE]
> Why is adding Anaconda to PATH not recommended?
> When you add Anaconda to the PATH, you are telling Windows: “Use Anaconda’s Python everywhere in the system.”
> It Overrides Your System Python.
> Many computers already have:-
> (a) Python installed by Windows Store.
> (b) Python installed by Microsoft tools.
> (c) Python installed manually.
> (d) Python used by other programs.
> If Anaconda is placed in PATH:-
> (1) It becomes the default Python for your entire system.
> (2) Other programs that expect the system Python may break.
> (3) It becomes confusing which Python you are running

✔ However if you do not have any previous version of Python installed on your system, then you may **Add Anaconda to my PATH environment variable**

✔ Register Anaconda as my default Python → Check this one

Click Install.

##### 1.2.7 STEP 7 — Wait for Installation

This may take 5–10 minutes.

##### 1.2.8 STEP 8 — Finish

Click `Next → Next → Finish`.

You're done installing Anaconda!

#### 1.3 PART 2: Launching Jupyter Notebook (After Installation)

There are two easy methods.

##### 1.3.1 METHOD 1: Use Start Menu

1.  Press `Start`.

2.  Search `Anaconda Navigator`.

3.  Open it.

4.  On the home screen, click `Launch` under Jupyter Notebook.

✔ This opens Jupyter Notebook in your browser.

##### 1.3.2 METHOD 2: Use Anaconda Prompt

1.  Open Start → search Anaconda Prompt → open it.

2.  Type:

`jupyter notebook`

Press Enter.

✔ Jupyter Notebook will open in your browser.

1.3.3 You Now Have Jupyter Notebook Installed!

#### 1.4 PART 3: OPTIONAL Installing Jupyter Notebook Without Anaconda

If you already have Python installed, you can install Jupyter with pip.

##### 1.4.1 STEP 1 — Check Python Installation

Open Command Prompt:-

`python --version`

If Python is installed, continue.

1.4.2 STEP 2 — Install pip (if not already installed)

Usually pip comes with Python. Check:

`pip --version`

##### 1.4.3 STEP 3 — Install Jupyter Notebook

Run:

`pip install notebook`

##### 1.4.4 STEP 4 — Launch Notebook

jupyter notebook

#### 1.5 PART 4: Setting Up a Virtual Environment for Jupyter

(Optional but recommended)

##### 1.5.1 STEP 1 — Create Environment

`python -m venv myenv`

Note:- In above `myenv` is the name of your virtual environment.

> [!TIP]
> You can name your virtual environment anything you like.
> However by convention, many a times it is named `.venv` . This is because in many operating systems (Like Linux and macOS) files and folders starting with a dot are conventionally hidden from default directory listings.
> This is done to protect important system or configuration files.
> However on Windows, a specific "hidden" attribute must be set.

##### 1.5.2 STEP 2 — Activate Environment

Windows:

`myenv\Scripts\activate`

##### 1.5.3 STEP 3 — Install Jupyter Inside This Environment

`pip install notebook`

##### 1.5.4 STEP 4 — Launch Jupyter

`jupyter notebook`

#### 1.6 PART 5: Verifying Everything Works

In Jupyter:

1.  Click New → Python 3 (ipykernel).

2.  In the first cell, type:

`print("Hello Jupyter!")`

3.  Press `Shift + Enter`.

If it prints the message, your setup is perfect.

#### 1.7 Some more details of the local server when you launch Jupyter

[Back to the Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

When you start Jupyter Notebook, it automatically launches a local web server on your computer.

The link you see —

`http://localhost:8888/tree`

— is the address (URL) of that local server.

Here’s what each part means, in simple terms:

##### 1.7.1 `http://`

This means you are using the HTTP protocol, the same protocol used for regular websites.

##### 1.7.2 `localhost`

This means:

•  The server is running on your own computer, not on the internet.

•  `localhost` always refers to your own machine.

•  It is the hostname for IP address `127.0.0.1` (loopback address).

So opening localhost is like telling your browser:

"Connect to a server running on my own computer."

##### 1.7.3 `:8888 (Port Number)`

Computers can run many servers at the same time, each identified by a port.

Port `8888` means:

  -  Jupyter Notebook server is listening for connections on port 8888.

  -  If another service is already using 8888, Jupyter uses 8889, 8890, etc.

So:

`localhost:8888`

means:

“Connect to the server on my computer at port 8888.”

##### 1.7.4 `/tree`

This is the route or endpoint that displays the file browser view.

This view is called the Tree View because:

  -  Your files are shown like a branching folder tree. The Jupyter interface you see (list of folders/files) is called the Tree View.

  -  You can navigate up and down directories

  -  You can open, delete, rename, or create new notebooks

So /tree loads:

The main home screen where you pick notebooks to open.

If you open a notebook, URL changes, for example:

  -  `/notebooks/MyNotebook.ipynb`

  -  `/edit/somefile.py`

  -  `/terminals/1`

  -  `tree` = File Browser View

It refers to the directory tree — the list of folders and files on your computer, displayed in a hierarchical (tree-like) structure.

##### 1.7.5 Putting it all together

`http://localhost:8888/tree` means:

“Open the Jupyter Notebook server that is running on my own computer (localhost), using port 8888, and display the tree (file browser) interface.”

This is why everything runs locally — no internet needed.

##### 1.7.6 How the flow works

1.  You start Jupyter Notebook.

2.  It starts a Python-based server on your computer.

3.  That server listens on localhost:8888.

4.  Your browser opens the Jupyter UI at /tree.

5.  You interact with notebooks via your browser.

6.  The browser communicates with the Jupyter server.

7.  The server communicates with the Python kernel.

#### 1.8 You can think of Jupyter Notebook as having two main screens:

[Back to the Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

##### 1.8.1 Screen 1: The Tree View (Home Page)

URL: http://localhost:8888/tree

This is the first screen you see when Jupyter starts.

It functions like a file manager.

Here you can:

  -  Browse your folders

  -  See files and subfolders

  -  Create new notebooks

  -  Open existing notebooks

  -  Upload files

  -  Open terminals

It’s similar to a “home page” or “dashboard.”

##### 1.8.2 Screen 2: The Notebook Editor (When a notebook opens)

URL example:

http://localhost:8888/notebooks/myfile.ipynb

This is the actual interactive coding environment where you write Python code in cells.

Screen shot of the UI of Screen 2 is given below (Note that the UI elements may vary from one system to anothet depending upon the installation/ version)




In this screen, you get:

  -  Menu bar

  -  Code cells

#### Relationship between the 2 screens of the Jupyter Notebook UI






##### 1.8.3 Relationship Between the Two Screens

•  The tree view is like a launcher.

•  The notebook editor is the actual work screen.

You always begin at Screen 1, unless you directly launch a notebook from the command line.

##### 1.8.4 Simplified Visual Explanation

```python
Start Jupyter
↓
Tree View (file browser)
↓ (open a file)
Notebook Editor (where you code)
```

#### 1.9 UI

[Back to the Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

1.9.1 Screen 1 — Tree View (the Jupyter home / file browser)

URL example: http://localhost:8888/tree

This is the first page Jupyter opens. It behaves like a simple file manager for the folder where you launched Jupyter.

Given below is the screen shot of Screen 1 with the “New” button clicked. It is from here that you select the various options to get the next screen. In most cases, you want to start a new Jupyter notebook, for which you may click the “Python 3 (ipykernel)”. But you may click other options as per your need.

##### 1.9.2 UI of screen 1

![UI of 1st screen when you run Jupyter Server](https://github.com/ag999git/python-book-2026/blob/main/all-book-images/UI-Screen1-Jupyter-NB.jpg)


The sreen shot shows the options available when one clicks the `New` Button. (The options may vary from one machine to another)
1. `.venv` is a virtual environment
2. `Java` is another kernel (of Java) installed
3. `Python 3 (ipykernel)` is the default system Python Kernel.
4. `Text File` creates a new blank `.txt` file.
5. `Folder` creates a new folder in the current directory.
6. `Terminal` opens a command-line terminal in your browser.

`.venv`

  -  This is a virtual environment you created inside your project folder named .venv.

  -  Jupyter detects it and shows it as a kernel.

  -  If you select it, notebook cells will run using the Python interpreter inside .venv.

Useful when you want isolated packages for one project.

`Java`

  -  This means you have a Java kernel installed (e.g., via IJava).

  -  You can write and run Java code inside a notebook.

Example cell:
```java
System.out.println("Hello from Java!");
```
`Python 3 (ipykernel)`

  -  This is the default Python kernel that comes bundled with Jupyter.

  -  It uses your system-wide Python installation (not inside a venv).

  -  This is the most common option for general use.

`Text File`

  -  Creates a new blank .txt file.

  -  Opens a simple text editor in the browser.

  -  Useful for notes, config files, or documentation.

`Folder`

  -  Creates a new folder in the current directory.

  -  Helps you organize project files.

`Terminal`

-  Opens a Linux-like command-line terminal in your browser.

-  Lets you run:

  -  pip install

  -  git commands

  -  virtual environment activation

  -  python scripts

  -  bash commands

This is very powerful and often used for managing environments.

##### 1.9.3 Parts of various toolbars/ panels in the UI

###### 1 Header / Top Bar

  -  Title — shows “Files” or the notebook server name.

  -  Logo / Brand — small Jupyter logo and sometimes server info.

  -  Useful for: Orienting you; no actions here typically.

###### 2 Toolbar (near top of page)

Common buttons you’ll see:

-  New → menu to create:

  -  New Python 3 notebook (or other kernels)

  -  New text file

  -  New folder

  -  New terminal (opens a shell tab)

- Upload → upload files from your computer into the current folder

-  Refresh → re-scan the directory (useful when files were added externally)

-  Control / Shutdown (may appear in other views)

Tip: Use New → Notebook to quickly create a .ipynb ready to run.

###### 3 File / Folder list (the “tree”)

-  Shows all files and folders in the current directory.

-  Each row usually shows:

  -  Filename (click to open)

  -  Last modified time

  -  File size (sometimes)

-  Right-click / three-dot menu on a file offers:

  -  Open, Rename, Duplicate, Download, Delete, Move, Edit, View

  -  For notebooks you may also see “Shutdown” (stops its kernel)

Tip: Clicking a folder enters it; clicking a notebook opens the editor (screen 2).

###### 4 Breadcrumb / Current path

•  Shows which folder you are viewing.

•  Click parents to go up one level.

###### 5 Running / Sessions (sometimes a tab or menu)

•  Running or Active sessions shows kernels/notebooks currently active.

•  From here you can shut down notebooks (stop their kernels) to free resources.

Why important: Closing a browser tab does not automatically stop the kernel — use this to shutdown.

###### 6 Search / Filter (if available)

•  Lets you find filenames in the current directory.

###### 7 Footer / Server info

•  May display the URL, token, or server messages.

•  Shows the directory that is being served (where files are stored).

##### 1.9.4 Screen 2 — Notebook Editor (the interactive coding screen)

URL example: http://localhost:8888/notebooks/myfile.ipynb

This is where you write and run code and see outputs.

###### 1 Browser URL & Notebook Name

•  The web page title usually contains the notebook name (myfile.ipynb).

•  Click the notebook name at top to rename it.

###### 2 Menu Bar (top row)

Typical menus (Already discussed earlier):

•  `File` — New, Open, Make a copy, Rename, Save and Checkpoint, Download as (HTML, .py, .ipynb), Close and Halt

•  `Edit` — Cut/Copy/Paste cells, Find & Replace

•  `View` — Toggle toolbar/menu/line numbers

•  `Insert` — Insert cell above/below

•  `Cell` — Run Cells, Run All, Cell Type (Code / Markdown)

•  `Kernel` — Interrupt / Restart / Reconnect / Change kernel

•  `Help` — Keyboard shortcuts, docs, kernel info

Tip: File → Save and Checkpoint creates a backup checkpoint. Browser autosaves periodically.

###### 3 Notebook Toolbar (icons under menu)
Already discussed earlier

Common buttons (left→right):

•  `Save` (floppy icon)

• ` Add cell, Cut/Copy/Paste cell, Move cell up/down`

•  `Run cell (▶) and Run all`

•  I`nterrupt kernel (stop), Restart kernel (⟳)`

###### 4 Kernel Status (top right)

•  Shows whether the kernel is Idle, Busy, or Disconnected.

•  Often a small circle: filled = busy, empty = idle.

•  Important actions:

  -  Interrupt — stop a running cell (like Ctrl+C)

  - Restart — clear memory and restart Python kernel

Tip: If state is “Busy” and your code is stuck, click Interrupt or Restart.

###### 5 Cells — the basic building blocks

•  Two main cell types:

  - Code cells — contain executable Python code

  - Markdown cells — for formatted text, headings, lists, images

•  Each cell has its own run button (▶ on the left) and an execution number like In [1].

•  Outputs (below a code cell) show printed text, tables, plots, or errors.

•  Cell toolbar and actions:

•  Add new cell (above / below)

•  Change cell type (Code / Markdown)

•  Delete cell

•  Move cell up/down

###### 6 Command Mode vs Edit Mode (keyboard behavior)

•  Edit mode (green border): typing inside a cell (press Enter to go into it).

•  Command mode (blue border): notebook-level commands (press Esc to enter).

•  Useful shortcuts:

  - Esc → Command mode

  -  Enter → Edit mode

  - A (in Command) → Insert cell above

  - B (in Command) → Insert cell below

  - M → change to Markdown

  - Y → change to Code

  - D, D (press D twice) → delete cell

  - Shift+Enter → run cell and advance

  - Ctrl+Enter → run cell, do not advance

  - Alt+Enter → run cell and insert new cell below

  - H → show all keyboard shortcuts

###### 7 Output Area

•  Renders results: text prints, images/plots (matplotlib), HTML, DataFrames, etc.

•  Rich outputs are supported (interactive widgets, JavaScript).

Tip: If many outputs make notebook slow, Clear Output from Cell menu.

###### 8 Sidebar / Additional Panels (depends on interface)

•  File browser can reappear (JupyterLab has persistent sidebars; classic notebook may not).

•  Variable inspector / extensions may add panels (if installed).

###### 9 Status / Messages (bottom or header)

•  Kernel connection errors, long-running warnings, or autosave messages appear here.

###### 10 Checkpoints and Saving

•  Jupyter autosaves, but you can make a manual Checkpoint (File → Save and Checkpoint).

•  You can Download as .ipynb (or export to HTML/PDF).

They help you manage the notebook, run system commands, measure performance, load files, debug, profile code, and more — all without leaving Jupyter.

Magic commands are like shortcuts or superpowers inside Jupyter.

They help you perform tasks such as:

✔ Checking your directory

✔ Timing your code

✔ Loading external scripts

✔ Running OS commands

✔ Controlling the Jupyter environment

✔ Displaying plots

✔ Debugging

✔ Saving variables across notebooks

They come in two types.

##### 2.1.1 Line Magics (start with %)

These run on a single line.

Example:-

`%pwd  # print working directory`

`%ls  # list files`

##### 2.1.2 Common Line magic commands in tabular form

  
  

  

| Name | Format | What It Does | Simple Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| %pwd | %pwd | Shows current working directory | %pwd |
| %ls | %ls | Lists files in the current directory | %ls |
| %cd | %cd foldername | Changes directory | %cd data |
| %who | %who | Lists defined variables in workspace | %who |
| %whos | %whos | Shows variables with details (type, size, etc.) | %whos |
| %reset | %reset | Clears all variables from workspace | %reset -f |
| %run | %run script.py | Runs a Python script inside the notebook | %run myfile.py |
| %time | %time statement | Measures execution time of a single statement | %time x = sum(range(100000)) |
| %timeit | %timeit statement | Runs the statement multiple times to give accurate timing | %timeit x = sum(range(100000)) |
| %matplotlib inline | %matplotlib inline | Displays plots inside notebook | %matplotlib inline |
| %store | %store varname | Saves a variable for use in another notebook/session | %store x |
| %history | %history | Shows command history | %history |
| %pip | %pip install package | Installs Python packages directly from notebook | %pip install numpy |
| %conda | %conda install package | Installs packages using conda from notebook | %conda install pandas |

##### 2.1.3 Cell Magics (start with %%)

These apply to the whole cell.

Example:

`%%time`

 entire cell is timed

```python

x = 0
for i in range(1000000):
    x += i
```

##### 2.1.4 Common Cell magic commands in tabular form

  

| Name | Format | What It Does | Simple Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| %%time | %%time | Measures execution time of the entire cell | %%timex = [i*i for i in range(100000)] |
| %%timeit | %%timeit | Runs full cell many times & averages the timing | %%timeitx = [i*i for i in range(100000)] |
| %%bash | %%bash | Runs the entire cell as Bash shell commands | %%bashecho "Hello"\nls |
| %%python | %%python | Forces execution using Python interpreter (useful in multi-kernel setups) | %%pythonprint("Hello") |
| %%html | %%html | Renders HTML content in output | %%html<h1>Hello</h1> |
| %%markdown | %%markdown | Renders Markdown as formatted output | %%markdown\n# Title |
| %%writefile | %%writefile filename.py | Writes the content of the cell to a file | %%writefile test.py\nprint("Hello") |
| %%capture | %%capture varname | Captures output (stdout, stderr) into a variable | %%capture outprint("Hidden") |
| %%latex | %%latex | Renders LaTeX math | %%latexE=mc^2 |
| %%javascript | %%javascript | Runs JavaScript inside notebook | %%javascriptalert("Hi!") |

### 3 Advanced concepts

#### 3.1 Flowchart

XYZ


##### 3.1.1 Explanation

###### A — Anaconda Navigator

Block: A[Anaconda Navigator]

This is the graphical launcher that comes with Anaconda.

You click an icon → Navigator opens → you see apps like Jupyter Notebook, Spyder, VS Code, etc.

Meaning:- The entire workflow starts when you launch Jupyter Notebook from Anaconda Navigator.

###### A → B — Starting the Notebook Server

Block: B[Starts Jupyter Notebook Server]

When you click “Launch” → Navigator runs the command:

jupyter-notebook

This starts something called the Jupyter Notebook Server.

The server is a Python program running locally on your computer.

###### B → C — Jupyter Server Running on Localhost

Block: C[Jupyter Server Running on Localhost]

The Jupyter server starts on something like:

http://localhost:8888

“localhost” means your own computer.

This server manages:

•  Notebook files

•  Saving

•  Communication with kernels

•  Security tokens

•  Sessions

###### C → D — Browser Opens Notebook Interface

Block: D[Browser Opens Notebook Interface]

After the server starts, your web browser opens automatically.

This web page is the Jupyter Dashboard (list of notebooks) and later the Notebook Editor.

Even though it looks like a website, the entire thing runs on your computer, not on the internet.

###### D → E — User Writes Code

Block: E[User Writes Code in Cell]

Inside the browser, you type:
```python
a = 10

a + 20
```

This is just text until you run the cell.

###### E → F — Browser Sends Code to Server

Block:

F[Browser Sends Code to Server]

When you press Shift+Enter, the browser sends your code to the Jupyter server using HTTP/WebSocket.

The server receives something like:

"Run cell with code: a + 20"

###### F → G — Server Sends Code to Kernel

Block:

G[Server Sends Code to Kernel]

The Jupyter server forwards the code to a kernel.

The kernel is a Python process running separately:

python.exe -m ipykernel

This is what actually executes your code.

###### G → H — Kernel Executes the Code

Block: H[Kernel Executes Python Code]

The kernel:

•  parses your Python

•  executes it

•  maintains variable states

•  stores your session memory

###### H → I — Python Produces Output

Block:

I[Python Produces Output]

This is simply the result of your code:

30

or a graph, or a printed message.

10. I → J — Kernel Sends Output to Server

Block:

J[Kernel Sends Output to Server]

After executing the code, the kernel returns:

•  the output

•  any errors

•  stdout (print)

•  rich outputs (plots, HTML, images)

It sends this back in a structured JSON message.

###### J → K — Server Sends Output to Browser

Block:

K[Server Sends Output to Browser]

The Jupyter server receives the kernel's JSON output and forwards it to your browser.

###### K → L — Browser Displays Output

Block:

L[Browser Displays Output in Notebook]

The browser renders the output below your code cell.

This completes the cycle:

1.  You write code

2.  It travels through server → kernel

3.  Kernel executes

4.  Result travels back

5.  Browser displays it

#### 3.2 Where does Jupyter Store Kernels

Common paths:

•  Linux / Mac:

`~/.local/share/jupyter/kernels/`

•  Windows:

`C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\jupyter\kernels\`

Each kernel has a folder with:

•  kernel.json

•  an icon

•  the executable path
